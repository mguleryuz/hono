# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on implementing a robust MongoDB-based RAG system that provides:

1. Vector search capabilities using MongoDB Atlas
2. Stable index creation and management
3. Type-safe client interface for memory operations
4. Testing infrastructure for the system

## Recent Changes

- Implemented MongoDB schema for embeddings with proper indexing
- Created a type-safe client interface for memory operations
- Added support for message and string-based memory creation
- Implemented vector search using MongoDB's $vectorSearch
- Added filtering capabilities based on user, agent, and session IDs
- Added test infrastructure for the system

## Current Challenges

1. **Index Creation Timing**: We've encountered issues with index creation timing in MongoDB Atlas. The vector search index takes time to become available after creation, which can cause early search operations to fail.

2. **Type Safety**: Ensuring proper type safety throughout the system while maintaining flexibility for different use cases has been challenging.

3. **Test Environment**: Designing tests that properly clean up after themselves and don't interfere with production data.

## Next Steps

1. **Index Management Improvements**:

   - Find a better way to handle index creation timing
   - Add verification of index status before performing searches
   - Implement retry mechanisms for search operations

2. **Additional Features**:

   - Implement memory summarization capabilities
   - Add support for batch operations
   - Create utility functions for common memory patterns

3. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Analyze and optimize query patterns
   - Add caching for frequently accessed memories
   - Implement appropriate MongoDB indexes for different query patterns

4. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Add detailed API documentation
   - Create example applications showcasing common use cases
   - Provide performance benchmarks

## Current Decisions

1. Using MongoDB Atlas as the vector database for its combination of document flexibility and vector search capabilities.
2. Employing OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model for generating embeddings.
3. Following a structure similar to the Mem0 API for consistency and familiarity.
4. Using Mongoose for schema management and type safety.
5. Implementing a clean separation between the data model and client interface.

## Open Questions

1. How to best handle index creation timing in MongoDB Atlas?
2. What's the most efficient way to implement batch operations?
3. How to handle very large datasets with efficient pagination?
4. Best practices for memory expiration and cleanup?
5. How to implement memory versioning and history tracking?
