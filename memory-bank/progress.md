# Project Progress

## What Works

- ✅ MongoDB Schema and Model for embeddings
- ✅ Type-safe interfaces for MongoDB documents
- ✅ Vector search implementation using MongoDB's $vectorSearch
- ✅ Creating memories from strings and message arrays
- ✅ Retrieving memories by ID
- ✅ Querying memories with filters (user, agent, run)
- ✅ Categorization and metadata support
- ✅ Pagination for large result sets
- ✅ Basic test infrastructure

## Partially Working

- ⚠️ Index creation and management (timing issues)
- ⚠️ Memory expiration (implemented but not fully tested)
- ⚠️ Automatic error handling during searches
- ⚠️ Batch operations (implemented but need optimization)

## Not Yet Implemented

- ❌ Memory summarization capabilities
- ❌ Advanced caching for frequently accessed memories
- ❌ Comprehensive logging system
- ❌ Performance benchmarking tools
- ❌ Full documentation and examples
- ❌ Support for custom embedding models

## Current Status

The core functionality of the MongoDB RAG system is operational. Users can store memories with embeddings, retrieve them using semantic search, and filter results based on various attributes. The system is type-safe and follows best practices for MongoDB schema design.

The most significant current issue is handling the asynchronous nature of index creation in MongoDB Atlas. Search operations may fail if they're executed before the vector index is fully available.

## Next Development Priorities

1. Fix index creation and verification process
2. Implement retry logic for search operations
3. Complete the test suite with comprehensive test cases
4. Implement memory summarization capabilities
5. Add documentation and examples

## Recent Accomplishments

- Implemented a fully typed MongoDB schema for embeddings
- Created a type-safe client interface for memory operations
- Added support for message and string-based memory creation
- Implemented vector search using MongoDB's $vectorSearch
- Added filtering capabilities based on user, agent, and session IDs
- Set up test infrastructure

## Known Issues

1. **Index Creation Timing**: Vector search index creation is asynchronous, which can cause early search operations to fail.
2. **Memory Organization**: Need better structures for organizing and prioritizing memories.
3. **MongoDB Connection Management**: Need to improve handling of connection states.
4. **Error Handling**: Should add more comprehensive error handling throughout the system.
5. **Test Environment**: Need better isolation and cleanup in test environments.
