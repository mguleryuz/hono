# Product Context

## Product Purpose

The MongoDB RAG implementation serves as a semantic memory system for AI applications, providing persistent storage and retrieval of context-aware knowledge. It enables AI systems to remember past interactions, learn from them, and provide more personalized and context-aware responses over time.

## Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) lack persistent memory between sessions and have context window limitations. They need a way to:

- Store and retrieve relevant contextual information
- Maintain memory across conversations and sessions
- Search through past knowledge semantically
- Organize memories for efficient retrieval
- Expire irrelevant or outdated information

## Solution Overview

This product provides a MongoDB-based implementation of a semantic memory system that:

- Stores text content with vector embeddings
- Enables semantic search based on meaning, not just keywords
- Organizes memories by user, agent, and session contexts
- Allows rich metadata and categorization
- Supports automatic expiration for temporary memories

## User Persona: AI Application Developer

- Needs a simple API to store and retrieve contextual information
- Wants to enhance AI applications with persistent memory
- Requires efficient semantic search for relevant context
- Needs flexibility to organize memories in a way that makes sense for their application
- Wants control over memory persistence and expiration

## User Persona: AI Agent

- Needs to remember user preferences and past interactions
- Wants to recall relevant information from previous sessions
- Should maintain context over long periods of time
- Requires efficient filtering to find the most relevant memories
- Needs memory management to avoid information overload

## Key Use Cases

### 1. User Preference Memory

AI applications need to remember user preferences across sessions. The MongoDB RAG system allows storage of preferences with proper categorization and metadata, retrievable through both exact and semantic search.

### 2. Conversation History

Applications can maintain conversation history, enabling AI agents to refer back to previous discussions and maintain continuity. Different conversation sessions can be tracked using run_id, while still being associated with the correct user.

### 3. Knowledge Management

Custom knowledge bases can be stored with semantic search capabilities, allowing AI applications to augment their responses with domain-specific information retrievable by meaning rather than exact keyword matching.

### 4. Short-term Context

Temporary context relevant only to the current session can be stored with appropriate expiration dates, automatically cleaning up when no longer needed.

### 5. Multi-agent Memory

When multiple AI agents serve the same user, memories can be shared across agents when appropriate, or kept specific to each agent-user relationship.

## Product Requirements

### Essential Requirements

- Store text content with vector embeddings
- Perform semantic search with relevance scoring
- Filter memories by user, agent, run (session)
- Support metadata and categorization
- Enable memory expiration

### User Experience Goals

- Simple, intuitive API
- Type-safe implementation
- Consistent response formats
- Meaningful error messages
- Efficient search performance

## Success Metrics

- Query response time under 200ms for typical searches
- Support for millions of memory entries per user
- High relevance scores for semantically similar content
- Minimal setup requirements for new projects
- Compatibility with different embedding models
